# In the past we used to depend on:
#   circleci/buildpack-deps:trusty-curl
#
# The main reason to change the base image was that
# the distribution conflicted with GHC linking phase
# with c libraries (e.g. hookup depends on openssl and
# it was impossible to build the project using the previous
# image).
